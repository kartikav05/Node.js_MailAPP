# Node.js_MailAPP
A node.js app which replies automatically to the unread messages using Gmail API in random Interval of time

## Libraries and Technologies Used:

* googleapis:
The googleapis library is used to interact with the Gmail API provided by Google. It is used to retrieve and manipulate email messages. The library provides a number of methods for accessing the Gmail API, including methods for listing messages, retrieving messages, and sending messages. The library also provides a number of classes for representing Gmail objects, such as messages, labels, and threads.

* nodemailer:
The nodemailer library is used for sending emails. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and sending email messages. The library supports a number of different mail servers, including Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail. The library also supports a number of different email formats, including plain text, HTML, and MIME.

* dotenv:
The dotenv library is used to load environment variables from a .env file. It allows storing sensitive information like API credentials in a separate file and keeping them out of the codebase. The library loads the environment variables into the process's environment when the application starts. This allows the application to access the environment variables without having to hard-code them into the application's code.

##  Areas where code can be improved:

* This code does not have any error handling mechanisms.The error may occur during API requests or while sending emails.I think we can implement  error handling mechanism so that it can provide proper feedback in case of any errors and also prevent from app crashing.

* This code could be divided into smaller functions or modules to improve code readability and maintainability. Separating the functionality into reusable functions can make the code more organized and easier to test and debug.
